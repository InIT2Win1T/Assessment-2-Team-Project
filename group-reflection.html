    <p id="u1411-3">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-5">There is a unanimous view amongst the five members of our group that we worked well as a group and that everyone contributed and finished their delegated tasks within an appropriate time frame. We also collectively feel that everyone showed a degree of initiative. We had a member pull out of the course prior to the commencement of the assignment as well as another pull out in the early stages. Despite this, we were able to obtain a new member (Josh) who managed to pick up from this with no trouble.</p>
    <p id="u1411-6">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-8">As a group we were all assigned tasks to complete, which was done successfully. Every member has been actively participating within group meetings as well as regularly using Discord outside our scheduled team meetings. Whenever anyone had a query and needed assistance with anything, every other member of the group was willing and able to assist in this regards.  </p>
    <p id="u1411-9">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-11">In regards to meetings, these were held twice a week and every member attended unless they had advised of a prior engagement, and if this was the case that team member was brought up to speed by the other team members before the next scheduled meeting. In doing this, we were able to make sure that everyone was progressing with their own and group tasks and that no one was left doing more work than anyone else. </p>
    <p id="u1411-12">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-14">Justin volunteered to take the meeting minutes, Nick did the agenda and the meeting recordings. Simon and Josh were backup for meeting minutes if Justin was unable to attend. Simon also took on the role of combining all the tasks that each team member was assigned and compiled it into the final PDF document. Shang was responsible for uploading the website to our group GitHub repo as well as having the website hosted. Nick was responsible for the website creation, with the design elements decided on by the group.</p>
    <p id="u1411-15">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-16">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-18">Josh’s Reflection</p>
    <p id="u1411-19">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-21">Joining the group quite late I was thrown into an already very organized group which for me,made it very easy, I was given my tasks that Nick assigned me and I began my work. We have met on average 2 times a week, for about an hour on Microsoft Teams, except for this final week where we have met 3 times.</p>
    <p id="u1411-23">The group used Teams for our meets and uploading documents which worked well but we used discord as more of an informal communication tool as general text chat in teams is not very good.</p>
    <p id="u1411-24">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-26">Personally I'm very happy with how the group dynamic worked and how much effort everyone put in. I think Nick was a really good leader and he made it really easy for me to come in and know exactly what I was doing right from the first meeting. I think his clear direction and really good knowledge on the topic was a major factor to why the group as a whole had no disagreements or issues with any aspect of the assignment and i don’t think I'm the only one coming out of this feeling happy about how we went, which is also my biggest surprise about the assignment as a whole, how well we worked as a team.</p>
    <p id="u1411-27">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-29"><span id="u1411-28">Justin's Reflection</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-30">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-32"><span id="u1411-31">I think our group had a really good chemistry. We worked really well as a group and everyone completed all of their assigned task on time. The expectations we had of each other were clear from the start and I never felt disappointed with anyone’s input. Losing Alarn early was a bit of a challenge but we quickly reassigned his work and stayed on track despite being a team member down.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-33">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-35">The most surprising thing was how well we worked as a group with no arguments. For example picking out our project idea was an easy discussion to have. Also there was no conflict in terms of leadership. Our team had a clear leader in Nick and he did a great job leading the team meetings. Also, I’d like to give a shout-out to Simon for his work in the group. He expanded on the project idea with research into the tools we require and also helped Nick out with the IT technologies and volunteered to put the PDF together for us.</p>
    <p id="u1411-36">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-38">I learned that working in groups is quite easy with the collaboration tools that we have today. I think having a clear leader giving direction and all of the group members having a common goal to do really well with our work enabled us to perform strongly as a team.</p>
    <p id="u1411-39">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-42"><span id="u1411-40">I think we could have improved in our use of GitHub. However, we only realized late in the assignment that there was a requirement for a commit trail which, for us, wasn’t really necessary as Nick was the website architect and the rest of us did our work purely on the write ups. That shows that for A3 we should probably have an in depth read of the assignment and rubric before we get started.</span></p>

    <p id="u1411-47">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-49"><span id="u1411-48">Within our&nbsp; group (Team 8 - InIT2Win1T), we were very motivated and were able to communicate with each other extremely well from the start. We have had regularly scheduled meetings every Wednesday night and Sunday night using MS teams as well as using Discord to communicate anything needed outside the scheduled team meetings. Initially we had 6 members but 2 of these dropped out and we gained 1 other, putting our team size at 5. We discussed this and came to the conclusion that although 6 members is recommended for this assignment, with the 5 members that we have, it was decided to stick at this.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-50">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-52"><span id="u1411-51">Every member has been actively participating in every aspect of the assignment, not just their assigned tasks. We came together from the beginning on the project idea after an in depth group discussion, decided on roles assigned to each member based on their preference and even with 1 member leaving half way through the second week and another joining, we managed this very successfully and with minimal disruption.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-53">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-55"><span id="u1411-54">Using both MS Teams and Discord to communicate enabled us to make sure that everything that needed to be done within the assignment was adequately done as well as enabling each member to communicate outside scheduled MS Teams meetings.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-56">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-58"><span id="u1411-57">Although MS Teams worked well for meetings, enabling recordings, attendance records and transcripts, as a communication tool comparative to discord, MS Teams was not as functional in my personal opinion.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-59">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-61"><span id="u1411-60">Simon's assistance with my own task was greatly appreciated as it was a lot to complete and his assistance was greatly appreciated</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-62">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-64">Shang’s Reflection</p>
    <p id="u1411-65">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-67"><span id="u1411-66">The assigned roles based on personality traits have worked wonderfully. Under terrific leadership, tasks were allocated based on free will and approved upon consensus from our earliest Microsoft Teams teleconference. Throughout the weeks, every member of the team was made aware of how each other is progressing in their respective task at the start of every session and discussion around issues and concerns were carried out either on Microsoft Teams or on Discord. Clear direction from Nickolas, collaboration between passionate group members and open channels for communication have facilitated the delivery of this assignment.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-68">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-70"><span id="u1411-69">Our group did encounter some hiccups here and there. As this is a group assignment and everyone has his/her life agenda, unforeseen circumstance is somewhat to be expected. Take our group for example, one of our beloved team members had to withdraw from the subject abruptly second week in. However, this was quickly resolved by the introduction of a new team member who enthusiastically took his forerunner's workload. Other than that, we also had to contend with technical issues on MS Meet as some sessions were not recorded correctly due to technical difficulties. Overall, I am surprised how impressively smooth this Online group work turned out.</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-71">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-73"><span id="u1411-72">Simon's Reflection</span></p>
    <p id="u1411-74">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1411-76">I believe the whole process of working together as a group has gone well. We have all made the effort to contribute, Nickolas showed good leadership, we all showed commitment as well as initiative and it seems as if not only I personally but the group collectively felt positive about the way we worked. There was no conflict and everyone seems to be getting along well. Our meetings very focused on the task at hand with little to no distraction. There was the occasional joke which is good for group dynamics. On occasions, some of us were a bit too quiet. One of us would talk, then if for example a question was asked, it would take a while for the rest to speak up. Sometimes it takes time to process thoughts though. I was a bit surprised how well we could make group work happen even considering we all live great distances from each other. Distance was the one thing making me wonder how well group work could happen. We have good tools, MSTeams, Discord, and others to help make this happen. I have learned that we do have more than enough tools to make long-distance group work happen and that varied personality types and experience brings different strengths to a group.</p>
