    <p id="u1408-2">Project Ideas</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1408-4">Overview</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our collaborative project idea is to design an app, which will also have a web-based version, which functions as a tool to assist Fantasy Football players. There will be a free version with ads as well as a paid, ad-free version of the app. Similarly, with the website, there will be a paid version which is accessed via a login portal as well as a free version. This tool will utilise a database to read AFL player statistics and display these statistics in an east to read format. Statistics based on disposals, goals and fantasy points which will be displayed in two different displays; the first display being in a line graph and a second display which will be a box plot that displays quartiles. The box plot is because player statistics are currently gauged by the player’s average and this is not always the most accurate representation of overall performance. Users will have the ability to filter data in accordance with venues and opponents to give the user a more accurate and specific analysis.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AFL Fantasy is a numbers game. The user begins with a set amount of money to create a team and players score points based on their statistics. On a weekly basis, player prices fluctuate based on their performance. A strategy required to win is to select players when they are expected to rise in price and trade players out when they are expected to drop in price. Users can compete for cash with their friends in head-to-head leagues and the user with highest overall score for the year will win a car.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1408-15">Motivation</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are 128,725 teams registered in AFL Fantasy in 2021. This number does not include players of other formats such as SuperCoach and Draftstars. Although these teams are fanatical there are no tools available to help users research and make decisions in terms of creating a team and making trades. One app is available which costs $20 per year which just shows averages and breakevens which are already readily available online. Because there is a lack of tools that enable users of AFL Fantasy to analyse data in more depth and in a simplified and concise enough way, we believe that a much more helpful tool could be developed that would be popular with AFL Fantasy participants. Especially given the fanatical nature and the winning prize being a car.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Above: An example of AFL Fantasy being played (The Traders, 2020)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-5">Description</p>
    <p id="u1575-6">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The primary purpose of this app is to provide Fantasy AFL users a simple visual aide to help them make decisions required. With the addition of filters, users can specify what sort of data they want to view in order to get an advantage over their opponent if they get it right. We envision this as a database which is updated weekly with player statistics. The data will then feed into the apps user interface which will display the data as graphs with are easy to read. The app will also display commentary that is based on the shown statistics such as “Player X has never kicked less than 3 goals when playing against Team Y” or “Player X usually plays poorly against Team Y with only 1 score over 90 in 7 games”. Additionally, we would like to add a bot to the app that makes suggestions to the user as to which players are due to have good or bad form. This however, is the option that would be the biggest challenge in creating this app.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There would be both paid and free versions of the app and website. The paid versions offer ad-free and a more seamless experience. The website will contain ads in forms such as banners, paid users can access a cleaner view when logging in through a sign-in portal. The app version would have ads that show videos when users open up screens. Paid users will have these ads disabled. The free versions will not limit main features. This will be similar to services such as YouTube, where users are required to view ads and can not run the app in the background on mobile devices. YouTube premium, which is a paid service, eliminates these but still enables users to most features. The version will not guarantee a higher chance of winning in AFL fantasy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-13">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-15">Below is a brief description of the possible features:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-17">Score and statists analysis</span> - which includes visual aides and graphs to assist the user with player selection.</p>
    <p id="u1575-20">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-21">Team Sheets</span> - Primarily to be used in the pre-season. This allows users to pick players for their teams and play around with them before the season starts without the user having to change their actual team.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-25">New Updates</span> - Features news relevant to AFL Fantasy which includes updates from AFL clubs such as injuries, potential debuts, role changes and training reports.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-29">Best 22 on form</span> - A quick reference guide which is updated weekly showing the players in each position with the highest scores in the last 3 rounds.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-33">Bunnies</span> - A section that lists the players that always play well against certain teams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-37">Kryptonite</span> - A section that lists the players that always perform poorly against certain teams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-41">Captain Suggestions</span> - In AFL Fantasy, captains earn double points. This feature will outline players best placed to get high scores.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-47">Funding</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Initially the project would need funds in order to support the development of the project. A crowdfunding site such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo or GoFundMe could be used in order to the project up and running. However, according to Narek (2001), these platforms are generally unsuitable for software or apps as there are few success stories regarding these with software. An alternative funding means is likely to be a government grant. After the project has been completed, the ads and paid accounts would cover the continual functioning of the app and website. An example of a grant that would help is Entrepreneurs’ Programme - Accelerating Commercialisation: <a class="nonblock" href="https://www.grants.gov.au/Go/Show?GoUuid=b9f07dbc-ea6f-300b-212b-f3a5c324886a" target="_blank" title="Govenment Gants ">https://www.grants.gov.au/Go/Show?GoUuid=b9f07dbc-ea6f-300b-212b-f3a5c324886a</a><a class="nonblock" href="project-ideas.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-58">Tools and Technology</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The app would need to be developed on the cloud- most likely via PaaS service such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. We would prefer to use Amazon Web Services as not only would they provide the PaaS services for development but also the IaaS services for deployment (Drake and Turner, 2021). This would allow developers from multiple locations to work collaboratively on the software development side as well as serving as a “back up” so that developers need not fear losing any progress which could be a problem if data is stored on local machines only. Utilising the cloud would also allow the team to just pay for the services required to save money and just upscale or downscale according to changing needs at any given time. Virtual servers would be an effective way to test the software as well as host it once it has been developed, and proven to functioning at an optimal standard.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>According to Shnaider (2020), Javascript would be a good language to use as it is common for both Android and iOs as well as for web development. This way we can employ programmers who specialise in Javascript without having to worry too much about other languages.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“It is considered to be the best framework for mobile app development for both native OS. This means that the JavaScript language is used to create a cross-platform app that is developed that runs on different platforms instead of creating separate apps for each system.” (Shnaider 2020)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“JavaScript works with both HTML and CSS to offer interactive applications. With versatile functionality, it has become the go-to language for enterprise app development for most of the web development companies.” (Shnaider 2020)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are also development kits for both Android and iOS. THe following two are examples:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Apple Software Development Kit for iOS - <a class="nonblock" href="https://developer.apple.com/">https://developer.apple.com/</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Android Studio for Android - <a class="nonblock" href="https://developer.android.com/studio">https://developer.android.com/studio</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These could also bring niched development tools for the purpose of this project.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We believe an easy way for the data to be input, managed and presented would be to use a spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Excel would be the preferred as it has a higher number of available functions according to Rigg (2021). An artificial intelligence program would ideally need to be developed in order to capture data on AFL players each week for relevant and reliable online services and input the data into our database. These websites which the data is obtained from would need to be monitored regularly for the purpose of noting any changes to how the websites are set out and then making any changes to the artificial intelligence system accordingly. This is because any changes may mean the artificial intelligence system may no longer be “looking” in the right place.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While the artificial intelligence would be acquiring data from AFL sources, information obtained each week will need to be achieved for the purpose of checking that the data is being acquired and updated properly. These would involve Excel spread sheets that are archived on the cloud service in an intuitive manner that is simple for programs and human readers to reference. The information acquisition system would need to be able to check for missing information, as well as information that has not changed and note this. Human programmers will need to monitor this and also check the acquired information of a select group of AFL players and compare with the site to confirm data acquisition is working properly. Human programmers, who analyse the data can input helpful commentary and insights into the system for users who are viewing the app can read.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Excel spreadsheets, would be stored on an Amazon Web Services along with the main software that controls the app. Users who are using the app on their mobile phones and the main cloud-based software would be intermediated by an Application Programming Interface that communicates to the servers what information the user is requesting and then sending back the desired information to display statistics, line graphs and boxplots. The main software would write, archive and refer to the excel-based data.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Should users need to include personal information, in order to create an account, data would need to be kept secure. Penetration testing would need to be carried out during development as well as regularly after release in order to keep personal data as private as possible and have the chance of being hacked at an optimal minimum.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-102">Skills Required</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-104">Analytics </span>- to provide the commentary and insights related to the AFL results that users would like to be shown. This would also be required to ensure the data is being acquired accurately.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-108">Coding and Programming </span>- to build the tool from the ground up. Javascript would be the language of choice for web development. Programmers who can use development kits for Android and iOS would be required also.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-112">Automation</span> - to enable automatic data updates every week so that data regarding 400 players does not need to be entered manually every Sunday night. This will mean that the tool is fully functional for all users. This is likely to require some more advance programmers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-116">Security </span>- users will need to enter some basic details in order to use this tool. For the sake of privacy, this data needs to be protected.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-120">Mobile app development </span>- for the purpose of having both a web-based version and a phone-based version.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-124">Testing </span>- in order to identify bugs before releasing to the public as well as being able to update as required.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1575-130">Feasibility and Scalability</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Much of the technology for this project is pre-existing, in that the project basically works by collecting data from relevant sources and using spreadsheets to store, manage and output the data. Although the is some artificial intelligence being used, it is generally a matter of programming where to look for the information from the sources. This means this project is quite feasible and can be achieved in a reasonable time frame as well as with a reasonably small team.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1575-136">Outcome</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The finished product would be a subscription service without ads or a free service with ads. Because there is nothing on the market like this at the present we believe that it will gain quick popularity. Also, due to the number of accounts this will generate an adequate amount of income to be sustained. The release date for the app would be around January of the year that it is ready to allow considerable time for word to spread prior to the AFL season starting. This app could potentially reach a wider market than AFL Fantasy users as it could be beneficial to punters and people who take part in “footy tipping”. Upon success of the app, this could expand for development of other apps for use of other fantasy sports games.</p>
