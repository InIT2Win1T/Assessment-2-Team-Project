    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-5">What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>During assessment one the group all individually choose their ideal jobs in the IT industry, Firstly Simon highlighted that his ideal job was a Software Developer specifying .NET, web and cloud, in the Burning Glass data i found that ‘.NET dev’ was quite accurate and ranked at number 3 most occupied jobs in the IT field. The next highest was Josh choosing to be a Software Engineer, which ranks number 19 in the Burning Glass data. Shang’s ideal job is a Cyber Security Analyst, which ranks 43rd. Nick’s was tougher to pin down a number to on the Burning Glass data as he chose Penetration Tester. While doing some research, Security Consultants are often referred to as Penetration Testers, and Security Consultant is listed at number 81. Finally Justin chose Business Analyst which is the lowest on the list of the group at 110.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-12">From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The group’s required skills set may appear quite fragmented, as two of the members are interested in a software development career, two in cybersecurity and finally Justin in business, but the IT skills required for the group can be very similar between fields. The IT required skill set for the group would be knowledge in IT systems such as C#, .NET, javascript,&nbsp; java, SQL,&nbsp; git, python, html and CSS. Everyone will also need to be proficient with Microsoft 365, Microsoft Windows and macOS at the very least. I find that set to be the main set of skills required of this group to succeed in our desired fields as well as completing this assignment. While each individual will have specialized skills such as certificates for Nick and Shang and business skills for Justin, the general skills set is much more similar between us all and features a lot of skills like communication skills, problem solving, writing, organizational skills, planning, team work, time management, meeting deadlines, multi tasking, creativity, quality assurance, analytical skills, english, decision making, troubleshooting, being detail oriented and presentation skills.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-19">How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The IT specific skill set that is required from our group is ranked quite highly as the group as a collective will need to know many if not all of the major and popular programming languages like java, javascript, C# and python as well as networking systems and cloud systems like AWS and also operating systems like windows and macOS. The group requires a lot of different skills and within the list of skills we will need at least 16 of these skills are in the burning glass’ top 25. This will provide the group with a great spread of relevant knowledge and skills to be successful in IT.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-26">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although skill and knowledge in IT topics is greatly important, so are general skills that apply across professions that are necessary to work efficiently and cooperatively in groups and in the workplace. The skills our group will need are communication skills, problem solving, writing, organisational skills, planning, team work, time management, meeting deadlines, multitasking, creativity, quality assurance and&nbsp; analytical skills, english, decision making, troubleshooting, being detail oriented, presentation skills. These skills rank highly in the burning glass data, as we will need to be effectively experienced in 17 of the top 15 general skills.[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]With ranking quite well with both IT and general skills, this will place each individual our group in a very strong position when looking for employers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-33">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our IT skill set covers a broad range of the top 25 IT skills in the burning glass data, though there are some important skills missing from our skill set. Most notably project management being ranked number 5, SAP at 6th and graphic design ranked 10th. These are the top 3 ranked skills that our skill set is missing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-40">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>inIT2winIT’s general skill set also covers a great number of the top 25 ranked skills in the burning glass data, though again the groups skill set has absences, and the top 3 ranked skills that we are missing are Leadership, ranked 11th, next is Mentoring at 13th and finally Self starter ranked at 24th.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u1399-47">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1399-49">Josh </span>- After looking at the burning glass data, my opinion has massively changed. I have definitely learnt a lot about what kind of jobs are actually in demand and what jobs are not. As well as what skills are more valuable to employers compared to others, i was specifically surprised to see python so low, i thought because of its mainstream popularity it meant it was one of the most used programming languages. If i was to change what my ideal job was now i would probably switch from software engineer to software developer, because after looking at the data i feel like ‘developer’ is much more of the standard developing job compared to ‘engineer’, although i wouldn't rule it out in the future if i spent time as a successful developer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1399-53">Simon </span>- According to the Burning Glass Data, software development, while still showing some active selections , was quite low compared to that of jobs such as solutions architects, graphic designers and .Net developers. Software engineering even, was even considerably higher up in terms of active selections. This has not yet driven me to make a drastic change in decision in terms of my ideal career. It has made me wonder more about the other higher demand positions that were mentioned and whether or not I should look into them more and what they involve. SQL, JavaScript and JAVA are highly sought after skills and ones that I would like to delve into more during my Information Technology degree. Baseline skills, such as communication (the highest sought after), problem solving, teamwork/collaboration and writing are skills that I have a reasonable degree of confidence in myself with. Organisational skills and leadership and skills I might need to work on a bit more.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1399-57">Justin </span>- Although Business Analyst is very low on the list of jobs according to demand, my ideal job has not changed.&nbsp; There are 2 main reasons for this.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Firstly, because the skill set required for a Business Analyst still has many of the skills required in the IT industry. Looking at the chart for baseline skills, all of these are a requirement of a Business Analyst. The only possible exception would be mentoring. The fact that I have already developed all of the skills on this list in my current and previous roles means that I already have the baseline skill set required for any role in IT should I wish to change roles in the future. In the list of specialised skills there are also a number of skills that are required by a Business Analyst. These are SQL, Javascript, Windows, Project Management, Business Management, Building relationships, Business analysis, Technical support, C#, Customer service, Microsoft Office, scrum and business process. Again this indicates that the role of a Business Analyst has a lot of skills that can be transferred to other roles in the IT industry.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The second reason that my ideal job hasn’t changed is that the role of a Business Analyst is not limited to the IT industry. A Business Analyst is essentially a problem solver and solving a range of problems (not just IT problems) is very appealing to me.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1399-67">Shang </span>- According to Burning Glass data, cybersecurity and information security related occupations made up merely 5 percent of the top occupations in Information Technology for the period between March 2017 to February 2018. Based on Labour Insight Jobs for the aforementioned period, SQL, JavaScript and Java are the top 3 skills in greatest demand. Although there is no mention of any programming language requirement in his ideal job, Shang acknowledges the importance of coding in a cybersecurity context and wishes to learn SQL and JavaScript languages to possess the ability to recognize application vulnerabilities and to prevent possible exploits. Apart from IT specific skills, Shang realizes the importance of generic skills such as communication, problem solving, collaboration and troubleshooting which are ranked first, second, fifth and sixth in greatest demand from employers. Specific mention of keywords such as “provide consultation”, “continually improve”, “participate” and “periodic review” in Shang’s ideal job post can further corroborate the value of such attributes. There are specialized IT skills that Shang thinks are irrelevant to his ideal job. These include and are not limited to website production, graphic design and business analysis. As for top generic skills, Shang believes he does not need to possess skills such as mentoring, team building, presentation and research. Shang has not been swayed by going through Burning Glass data and remains assertive in his chosen path. Initially, Shang was astonished by how scarce the demand was back in 2018 but believes its demand has since been on the rise with more businesses shifting towards telecommuting in and post-pandemic.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span id="u1399-71">Nick </span>- Based on the burning glass data, Cyber security or penetration testing ranks incredibly low comparative to all other jobs within IT. Almost every other job ranks higher in regards to being sought after and jobs available. This has not changed my ideal job choice at all. While I am aware that jobs for this are not as readily available, as technology advances these jobs will become more and more sought after as cybersecurity experts are required in almost every IT based company. When looking at the baseline skill set required for any role within IT, communication, teamwork, problem solving, complex reasoning and writing skills are all something that I excel in. I would be interested in further developing myself within JAVA and stack development as well as multiple different programming languages as well as machine learning, Specifically AI and deep learning as this is also something I believe will be desirable in the future</p>
